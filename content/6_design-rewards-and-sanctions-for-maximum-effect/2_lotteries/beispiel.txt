Text: <p>We have a tendency to focus more on the size of the prize at stake, rather than our chances of winning it.</p><p>Therefore, rather than rewarding everyone equally (e.g. 100 for anyone takes up a scheme), it may be cheaper and more effective to reward fewer people with a much larger reward.</p><p>The Behavioural Insights Team ran a randomised controlled trial with a local authority to test the efficacy of using lotteries to increase electoral registration rates. There was a 3.3% increase in registration rates when the prize was 1,000, and a 4.2% increase when the prize was 5,000.<br><br><br></p><p></p>
