Title: Search Dynamics in Consumer Choice under Time Pressure: An Eye-Tracking Study

----

Text: <p>When the subjects were shown nine options, their eyes first settled near the center approximately 99 percent of the time. When there were sixteen options, about 97 percent of their first fixations were on one of the four central tiles. What’s more, these first fixations predicted their ensuing gaze, as the same spots that people looked at initially remained the most popular spots for subsequent fixations.</p><p>(...) In fact, when the scientists placed the worst snack in a popular screen location—say, the middle left—people were able to find the best option only about 30 percent of the time. However, when their preferred snack was in the center, they had a “choice efficiency” of 91 percent, which means they almost always made the best choice, selecting the food they most wanted to eat.&nbsp; (The Smarter Screen, p. 69 ff)</p>
