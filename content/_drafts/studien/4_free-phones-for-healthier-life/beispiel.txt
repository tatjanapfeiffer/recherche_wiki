Title: Free Phones for healthier life

----

Text: <p>For instance, in a clinical trial currently in progress, a team of researchers at UCLA are giving women smartphones capable of tracking their movement and pinging them with health-related questions, such as whether or not they’re eating enough fruits and vegetables. The researchers have reported very promising results, as those women given the phones have shown significant decreases in blood pressure, cholesterol, and levels of stress and anxiety. They’ve also adopted healthier eating and exercise habits.35 I think this study has an obvious extension: we should start giving away free smartphones in exchange for a small allotment of attention from the smartphone user. Perhaps that attention is used to send subjects reminders to live a healthy life, or maybe to avoid risky behaviors. The point is that the messages would have to trigger only small changes in behavior before they paid for that phone. While it would cost roughly $75 billion to buy every worker in the United States a new smartphone—there are roughly 150 million people in the workforce, and a high-end smartphone without a contract costs about $500—that’s a much smaller amount than the costs associated with our unhealthy choices that these new smartphones might help prevent. For instance, according to a recent paper published in the Annals of Internal Medicine, patients failing to properly take their medication cost society somewhere between $100 billion and $289 billion every year.36 (It’s estimated that nearly 50 percent of prescriptions for chronic diseases are not used as prescribed.)37 Obesity, meanwhile, adds another $190 billion in direct health care costs. Drunk driving? $114 billion.38 Smoking? Nearly $290 billion.39 I’m not saying that a few targeted messages on your smartphone will cure nicotine addiction, or finally make that diet stick. But I do believe that technology can help at the margins, and thus reduce the magnitude of these very costly societal problems.</p>
