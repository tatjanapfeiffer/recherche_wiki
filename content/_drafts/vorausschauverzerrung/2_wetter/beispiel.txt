Title: Wetter

Text: <p>The projection bias often impacts our purchasing decisions. When making a purchase, we have to estimate how much utility we will derive from the good in the future. However, even something as simple as the weather is able to influence our predictions.</p><p>Meghan Busse, a professor of business strategy, along with a team of researchers, wanted to examine if weather conditions could activate the projection bias in a high-stakes environment: the car market.3&nbsp;Cars are durable goods, meaning that we have to predict the future utility of the car when deciding to purchase.</p><p>Busse and her team looked at sales data from dealerships across the U.S. for both used and new vehicles, alongside weather data such as temperature, cloud cover and snowfall.</p><p>The researchers found that warmer weather leads to an increase in convertible sales, both in the warmer and drier summer months, or when there was an abnormal increase in temperature in winter months. This purchasing behavior is likely due to the projection bias, where because it is a sunny warm day, consumers predict that their future utility of a car like a convertible, suited for summer weather, is greater than it actually is.</p><p>A similar pattern was found for cold weather, with sales of four-wheel-drive vehicles increasing during cold and snowy weather. These vehicles are more suited to winter conditions, and consumers incorrectly predict that their future selves will value the vehicle the same amount as their current selves, not realizing that they are currently being affected by the weather.</p>
