Title: Priming durch Logos

----

Text: <p>The present research examined the translation of social priming effects to the consumer brand context. Our first objective was to examine whether brand exposure can automatically shape behavior in the same fashion as can exposure to significant others and members of social categories. Experiments supported the existence of brand priming effects on behavior, finding that participants responded to brands by behaving in line with the brand’s characteristics and did so with no conscious awareness of the influence. Participants exposed to the Apple brand outperformed IBMprimed and control participants on a standard measure of creativity, and participants primed with the Disney Channel reported more honest responses to a social desirability test than did those primed with E! Channel logos or control participants. <br></p><p>(Automatic Effects of Brand Exposure on Motivated Behavior: How Apple Makes You “Think Different” GRA´INNE M. FITZSIMONS TANYA L. CHARTRAND GAVAN J.
