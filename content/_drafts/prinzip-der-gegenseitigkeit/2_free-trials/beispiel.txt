Text: <p>The Smarter Screen: "So what would happen if we treated attention as a literal resource? I think we’d do a better job of learning to value it. The Internet, after all, is already pretty transparent about the worth of attention. Google gives us free e-mail if we’re willing to put up with their targeted ads; Spotify offers a vast music library in exchange for short commercials; Amazon sells Kindles at a discount if shoppers look at their promotions.<strong> In all of these instances, we are bartering with our working memory, trading away the gaze of our eyeballs for discounted gadgets and free online services.</strong> What I want to do is find a way to value our attention for purposes other than advertising dollars."</p>
