Title: Humor Effekt

----

Definition: <p>Humor is one of the most extensively used methods of evoking positive responses to advertisements (ads). It has been estimated that between 30% and 42% of ads employ humor (Markiewicz, 1974; Weinberger, Spotts, Campbell, &amp; Parsons, 1995). On the basis of the total advertising expenditures in 2007, one can deduce that advertisers in the U.S. spend about $45 billion a year on humorous ads (TNS Media Intelligence, 2008). Despite its frequent use, empirical studies only offer piecemeal evidence in support of the practice. The most recent comprehensive review about the effect of humor in advertising stated that “the current conclusion from the overall literature concurs with the view that humor does not offer significant advantage over nonhumor when persuasion is the goal” (Weinberger &amp; Gulas, 1992, p. 56 –57, see also Sternthal &amp; Craig, 1973). </p><p>(<a href="https://sci-hub.st/10.1037/a0014812" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://sci-hub.st/10.1037/a0014812</a>, 15.04.2021)</p>
