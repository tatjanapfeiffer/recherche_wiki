Title: Attract Attention

----

Definition: <p>Behavioural scientists use the term ‘salience’ to describe the way in which people are more likely to respond to stimuli that are novel, simple and accessible. In other words, we are more likely to do something that our attention is drawn towards.</p><p>There are many ways to attract attention. One option is a more cognitive approach that finds new ways of highlighting the consequences of the behaviour, making the costs and benefits salient. </p><p>But we are also attracted by many other (less direct) factors, such as the feelings and associations triggered by how an object or idea is presented.</p>
