Text: <p>The projection bias causes us to make decisions that are short-sighted and based on current emotions, beliefs and values that will not necessarily hold up in the long run. Optimal decision-making requires us to make predictions about our future tastes but often these predictions are based on the logic that we will continue, in the future, to feel the way we feel today. Unfortunately, that is often not the case.</p><p>We are unable to put ourselves in the emotional or visceral state of our future selves. This is also known as the&nbsp;<strong><a href="https://thedecisionlab.com/biases/empathy-gap/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">“empathy gap”</a></strong>. We end up making decisions that will satisfy our current emotional state, such as eating a doughnut when hungry, but do not line up with our long-term goals, like trying to lose 5 pounds. Unfortunately, many of the decisions we make that involve the projection bias have to do with harmful behavior, such as over-indulging or trying harmful substances like cigarettes, thinking that our future selves will be able to resist addiction. The projection bias can easily lead to decisions we will later regret.</p><p></p><p>z.B Einkaufen gehen wenn man hungrig ist</p>
