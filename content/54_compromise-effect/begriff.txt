Title: compromise effect

----

Definition: <p>When choosing something, the Compromise Effect is the tendency to avoid an extreme choice. Avoiding an extreme choice is often due to the common perception that extremes attract risk. As the middle ground feels safer, decisions which exclude extremes are made far more readily.<br><br>Let's imagine you sell widgets. At the wholesalers, Widget A costs £3, Widget B costs £4, and Widget C costs £5. You could just whack a £2 mark-up on each and put them in your shop. But that is unlikely to herd people to what you want to sell them. The trick is to optimise the selection for herding. Do something like this:</p><ul><li><p>Widget A: £5</p></li><li><p>Widget B: £8</p></li><li><p>Widget C: £13</p></li></ul><p>Most people will now go for Widget B, giving you £4 profit per sale. Clearly, there are other dynamics at play. For example, if the widgets are cheaper elsewhere, your stock will be ignored. But the principle is sound. Most people will avoid extreme choices, and you can exploit that.</p><p><a href="http://www.howtogetyourownway.com/effects/compromise_effect.html" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">http://www.howtogetyourownway.com/effects/compromise_effect.html</a></p>
