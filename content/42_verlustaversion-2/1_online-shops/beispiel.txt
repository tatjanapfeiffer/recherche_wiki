Labeling products as scarce will help customers make decisions quicker.&nbsp;</p><p>There are four types of scarcity, which are:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Exclusivity Scarcity:&nbsp;</strong>Products that are available for a limited time or stock will e.g., Dynamic Messages like "Limited" and "Low Stock".&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Urgency Scarcity:</strong>&nbsp;Offers that are time-limited create a sense of urgency, e.g., Dynamic Messages like countdown banners or "Don't Miss Out".</p></li><li><p><strong>Excess Demand Scarcity:</strong>&nbsp;When the demand for a product outweighs the supply, this drives a shopper's fear of missing out. Dynamic Messages like "Only 4 left. Don't wait" will leverage this.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></li><li><p><strong>Rarity:&nbsp;</strong>These messages are geared for products that have a limited supply and will point out products that are unusual, stimulating the consumers' need for uniqueness. You can leverage this in the Dynamic Message "Rare" or "Limited Edition."</p></li></ul>
