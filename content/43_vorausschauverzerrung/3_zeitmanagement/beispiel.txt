Text: <p>When we are in a good mood, it is easy to predict that we will be able to complete a big task, because our current selves are optimistic and well-rested. However, we underestimate how much fatigue will affect our future selves and render us incapable of completing the task, often leading to us abandoning our task or having to spend much longer than anticipated on it.</p>
