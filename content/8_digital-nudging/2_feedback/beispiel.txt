Title: Feedback

----

Text: <p>The best way to help humans to improve their performance is to provide <em>feedback </em>(Thaler &amp; Sunstein, 2008). Providing users with feedback when they are doing well or making mistakes, as this will raise their consciousness (Weinmann, Schneider &amp; vom Brocke, 2016). An important kind of feedback is warnings when things are going wrong or about to go wrong. For example, the laptop warns the user before the battery runs out, so he or she has time to plug in the charger before the computer shuts down. By informing the user about what is going on by giving feedback, they can improve their behaviors (Thaler &amp; Sunstein, 2008), and potentially also perform less errors.&nbsp;</p><p><br>"What did Kluger and De Nisi find? While feedback interventions improved performance on average, in about 38 percent of cases the feedback actually led people to do worse. The dieters gained weight; the students struggled to learn; the workers were less productive. It’s a sobering finding, a reminder of just how hard it is to structure effective feedback. As we’ll soon see, the same pattern extends to the digital world: some feedback on screens makes us perform better and other feedback makes us perform worse." (The Smarter Screen p.84)</p><p>(...)</p><p>"Look, for instance, at a recent study by Swiss researchers that investigated the impact of feedback from “friends” on social media. Christian Hildebrand, a psychologist at the University of St. Gallen, was inspired by various shopping Web sites, such as Nike.com and Lego.com, that encourage customers to share their custom-designed purchases on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Pinterest. (Many of these sites offer coupons and rewards to customers who share.) Hildebrand wanted to know how all this sharing affected consumer choices and consumer satisfaction. Did the feedback from friends and strangers make us happier about our purchase? Were we more pleased with our new running shoes and Legos? The answer was a resounding no. (...) Our results show that feedback dampens creativity, reduces originality and diminishes customer satisfaction,” Hildebrand and colleagues write. ((The Smarter Screen, p.96))</p><p></p><p>According to the psychologist Adam Joinson at the University of the West of England, screens can lead to disinhibition because they remove the normal feelings of anxiety and self-consciousness that exist when we are judged by another person. (...) A clear pattern soon emerged: when the format of the questions was a text on a screen, people gave far more candid answers, with a third more people admitting to binge drinking in the last thirty days. (The Smarter Screen, p. 99ff)</p><p></p><p>(vgl. Christian Hildebrand, Andreas Herrmann, Gerald Häubl, and Jan R. Landwehr, “Conformity and the Crowd,” Harvard Business Review (July–August 2013): 23.)</p><p></p>
