Title: Armut und schädlichen Verhaltensmustern

----

Text: <p>In a 2013 study published in Science, a team of psychologists, including Anandi Mani, Sendhil Mullainathan, Eldar Shafir, and Jiaying Zhao, showed that a shortage of cognitive resources can also help explain the poor decision making of those living in poverty.16 (Studies show that people of lower socioeconomic status, for instance, are less likely to adhere to drug regimens, less likely to show up on time or keep an appointment, less focused at work, and worse at financial planning.)17 While conventional explanations focus on a lack of education as the root cause—poor people just don’t know any better—the scientists focus on “the mental processes required by poverty.” They argue that being poor is an all-consuming condition, and that a “preoccupation with pressing budgetary concerns” leaves people with fewer attentional resources to make long-term plans. “Being poor means coping not just with a shortfall of money, but also with a concurrent shortfall of cognitive resources,” they write.18 The scientists estimate that the cognitive impact of poverty is roughly equivalent to losing a full night of sleep or suffering a thirteen-point drop in IQ scores.
