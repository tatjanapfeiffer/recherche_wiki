Title: Humor Effect

----

Text: <p>The tendency to better remember humorous items than non-humorous ones.</p><p>Humor&nbsp;is one of the most extensively used methods of evoking positive responses to advertisements (ads). It has been estimated that between 30% and 42% of ads employ&nbsp;humor&nbsp;(Markiewicz, 1974; Weinberger, Spotts, Campbell, &amp; Parsons, 1995). On the basis of the total advertising expenditures in 2007, one can deduce that advertisers in the U.S. spend about $45 billion a year on&nbsp;humorous ads (TNS Media Intelligence, 2008). Despite its frequent use, empirical studies only offer piecemeal evidence in support of the practice. The most recent comprehensive review about the effect of&nbsp;humor&nbsp;in advertising stated that “the current conclusion from the overall literature concurs with the view that&nbsp;humor&nbsp;does not offer significant advantage over nonhumor&nbsp;when persuasion is the goal” (Weinberger &amp; Gulas, 1992, p. 56 –57, see also Sternthal &amp; Craig, 1973).</p><p>(<a href="https://sci-hub.st/10.1037/a0014812" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://sci-hub.st/10.1037/a0014812</a>, 15.04.2021)</p>
