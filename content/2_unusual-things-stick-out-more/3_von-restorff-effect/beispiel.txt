Title: Von Restorff Effect

----

Text: <p>Also called the isolation effect or bizarreness effect,&nbsp;the Von Restorff effect&nbsp;is the proven psychological theory that the more something stands out from the crowd the more likely it is to be seen. For example in a bucket full of green apples we’ll remember the red one. And be more drawn to it.</p><p>The Von Restorff effect&nbsp;is a phenomenon first coined by Hedwig Von Restorff – rejoice, a female behavioural scientist. She discovered in an experiment that when constructing lists of words, the one that’s different will usually be recalled more easily.</p><p>This could be that the word in question is longer than the rest, in a different typeface or language, emboldened, contains a number, is in a different font etc.</p><p></p><p><a href="#begriff-unusual-things-stick-out-more-beispiel-bizarreness-effect" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">siehe auch Bizarreness Effect</a></p>
