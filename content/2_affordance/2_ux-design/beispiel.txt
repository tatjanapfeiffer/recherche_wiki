Title: UX-Design

----

Text: <p></p><p><strong>Buttons</strong><br>Buttons are one of the core elements used to suggest interactivity in an interface. Shape, color, shadowing, contrast, and accompanying copy play a huge role in designing an obvious and effective button. It can be easy to accidentally create a hidden affordance by creating a button that doesn’t look clickable or, by contrast, a false affordance by making another item look clickable when it isn’t.<br><br><strong>Animations<br></strong>Animated affordances often imitate actions or movements in the real world (swiping, pushing, pulling, dragging, etc.) and range from simple to quite complex. Toggle buttons are simple animated affordances that show a user when something is turned on by the presence or change in color when the toggle is dragged. More complex animations can serve as negative affordances such as a button that shakes, blinks, or causes your phone to vibrate indicating that you cannot proceed just yet.</p><p></p><p><strong>Notifications</strong><br>Notifications are used to draw the user’s attention to something or to indicate a change. For example, say a user hasn’t completed setting up their profile, a red dot may appear next to the profile icon on the menu bar. Another good example is a number appearing next to a shopping cart icon when you’ve added something to your cart. Notifications should be obvious enough to notice, but not too distracting.</p><p></p><p><strong>Input fields<br></strong>Input fields indicate that a user can enter data. These are often conveyed by the shape of the field and the contrast between the field and it’s background. Furthermore, light or italicized text may be present to indicate exactly what info the user needs to input. Input fields can also appear as a drop down box indicating that the user needs to make a selection.</p><h3><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h3><p><strong>Icons<br></strong>Icons often rely on pattern or metaphorical affordance to help a user navigate through an interface. Conventions like using heart or star icons to indicate a “Favorites” page uses pattern affordance while a floppy disk icon as a “Save” button is relying on metaphorical affordance. Icons may also be used to help users understand categorization as users may perceive images faster than text.</p><h3></h3><p><strong>Photos</strong><br>Similar to icons, photos are quick visual cues that help users understand what they can do with a product. For instance, the website for a meal delivery service may have a slideshow with pictures of people cooking or the different meals they provide letting the user know what their product has to offer with just a momentary glance.<br>(<a href="https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/affordances-ux-design/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://careerfoundry.com/en/blog/ux-design/affordances-ux-design/</a>, 15.04.2021)</p><p></p><p><strong><a href="#begriff-big-data-beispiel-feedback" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">Feedback</a> </strong><br>I’ve got a weak spot for acrostics, those mnemonic devices in which the first letter in each line spells out a word. They’ve always been a useful memory compression device for me, helping my brain recall a complex process with a single cue. Below, I’ve recast my seven behavioral principles as an acrostic for the word DIGITAL.</p><p>Beispiel Red Alert App (App, die in Krisengebieten vor Bombenanschlägen warnt) <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/red-alert-israel/id873642097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://apps.apple.com/us/app/red-alert-israel/id873642097</a></p><ol><li><p><strong>Timing</strong>: Are you delivering your feedback at the most effective possible moment?</p></li><li><p><strong>Personalisation</strong>: Are you making personalization easy? Mirrors should be effortless.</p></li><li><p><strong>Dosage: </strong>Avoid Feedback Overdose. Are you delivering too much feedback? Don’t become noise.</p></li><li><p>Trigger a Feeling (--&gt; escalating reminders and sound)</p><p><strong>Intuitive</strong>: Are you taking advantage of the affect heuristic? We are intuitively drawn to information that triggers an emotion.</p></li><li><p>I<strong>ncooperate an Action Plan: </strong>Do people know how to react to your feedback? Does it come with a plan for improvement?</p></li><li><p>Encourage, don't critizise: Is your feedback too negative? If so, look for opportunities to offer up positive suggestions</p></li><li><p><strong>Follow the Evidence: </strong>Are you measuring the outcome of your feedback? Is it improving behavior? Never underestimate the uncertainty involved when trying to change human behavior.</p></li></ol>
