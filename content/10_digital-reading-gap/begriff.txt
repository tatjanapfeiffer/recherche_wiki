Title: Digital reading gap

----

Definition: <p>Bildschirme sind besser geworde, trotzdem lernt man weniger, wenn man am Bildschirm liest. (vgl. The Smarter Screen)</p><p>But (and this is a big but) making things easier is not always ideal. In particular, when it comes to learning and memory—the very skills measured in tests of reading comprehension—excessive ease has serious drawbacks. Sometimes, people actually remember more when the information is slightly harder to process; the perceptual struggle is a good thing. (The Smarter Screen p. 120)</p><p></p><p></p>
